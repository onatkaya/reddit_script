# script_reddit
Developed a script using the Reddit API and Python to retrieve information about a specific subreddit.

Write your subreddit of choice as input, and you see some stats about that subreddit as output:

* The number of all headlines
* The number of all DISTINCT headlines
* The number of DISTINCT users posted
* The average upvote score for all posts
* The user who has posted the most & The Number of total posts

Important Note: The authentication credentials ("client_id" and "client_secret") are hidden at the file "config.py", and that file is not shared on here for privacy concerns. Please make a request to see it fully working with credentials. Otherwise, user has to add their own details.

# Future plans

* Add new features
* Improve speed/decrease latency.
